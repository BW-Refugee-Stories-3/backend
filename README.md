## API Documentation

<br/>
<br/>

The base URI for this project will be `https://refugee-stories-build-week.com`, all requests must use this URL. For example, `https://refugee-stories-build-week.com/api/login`

<br/>

__Auth:__

<br/>

- `POST` to `/api/auth/register` with the following JSON structure attached to the request body:

```js
{
    "email": "user@website.com" // must be a valid email
    "story": "I want to be an admin very badly pls let me" // must be a string, max length 328 characters long
    "username": "refugeeAdmin" // required, must be at least 4 charaters long 
    "password": "aPassword" // required, must be at least 6 charaters long 
}

```

- `POST` to `/api/auth/login` with the following JSON structure attached to the request body:

```js
{
    "username": "refugeeAdmin" // must be at least 4 charaters long 
    "password": "aPassword" // must be at least 6 charaters long 

    // if successful - this will return a token that you will need to save to local storage. This will be required to access many of the end points below.
}

```



__Stories__

<br/>

- `GET` to `/api/stories/approved` will return a list of stories that the admins have approved

- `POST` to `/api/stories/process` endpoint for users to send a story to the admins for approval. Use this format:

```js
{
    "name":"refugeeName"  // 32 character max
    "location":"Albania"  // 32 character max
    "date":"1/2/2020" // 18 character max
    "textbody":"alotoftextthatdoesntmatter" // 328 character max 
}
```

:small_red_triangle: All of these endpoints below require the token from /api/login :small_red_triangle:

- `GET` to `/api/stories/process` returns a list of stories that need to be reviewed by admins

- `GET` to `/api/stories/process/:id`
returns a single item with a corresponding id.

- `DELETE` to `/api/stories/process/:id`
deletes a single item with the corresponding id.

- `PUT` to `/api/stories/process/:id`
updates a single item with the corresponding id. You only need to switch a boolean to true. When the boolean is true, that object will be related to the `/api/stories/approved` route. 


```js
{
    "approved": True
}

```
